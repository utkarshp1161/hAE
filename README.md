# Human-in-the-Loop: Automated Experiments (hAE)

## Description

The concept of Human-in-the-Loop for Automated Experiments (hAE) represents an innovative approach to scientific research, blending human expertise with automated systems to optimize experimental processes. This methodology leverages advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to enhance decision-making, data analysis, and experimental design. By incorporating human oversight, it ensures that the automated systems can adapt and refine their strategies based on expert feedback and unforeseen variables, leading to more efficient and effective research outcomes.
